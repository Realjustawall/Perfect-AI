# Implementation pattern — Gallery loading state / Data-heavy application / Tailwind CSS v4

**Pattern ID:** `ztf-tw-skeleton-gallery-dashboard` · **Design intent:** Preserve navigation and data density while supporting panel resizing and empty states.

## Before writing code
Audit the existing app and its actual framework version. Use Tailwind CSS v4 only if already selected or justified; never inject two CSS frameworks accidentally. Confirm the real content, loading states and integration routes.

## Executable markup starter
```html
<section id="skeleton-gallery-tw-data-heavy-application" role="status" aria-live="polite" class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 animate-pulse">
 <h3>Gallery loading state</h3><p>Loading your Data-heavy application content. An update will be announced here.</p>
</section>
```

## Framework-specific treatment
- **Utilities / layout:** `grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 animate-pulse`
- **Breakpoints and container:** sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280, 2xl 1536 default; use @container variants for reusable components.
- **Theme source:** Use top-level @theme to define utility-generating tokens and :root/[data-theme] for semantic alias variables.
- **RTL:** Use ms-*/me-*, text-start/text-end and dir-aware layout with rtl: variants.
- **Interaction and semantics:** Use role=status or an appropriate aria-live region; announce actual state transitions without flooding.
- **Performance:** native scrolling and static content first; avoid scroll event layout thrashing.

## Scenario-specific acceptance
Preserve navigation and data density while supporting panel resizing and empty states.
- Critical criterion: **Reserve layout height to avoid CLS**.
- Test widths: 320,390,768,1024,1280,1920 CSS pixels, plus portrait/landscape and nested sidebars.
- Test Persian labels that expand beyond the English length and preserve full context at 400% zoom.
- Confirm focus navigation, screen-reader purpose, reduced-motion behavior and no JavaScript failures.
- If the example is a shell rather than full product behavior, wire real app state/API and test it before claiming fully functional.

## Accessibility and visual QA
Use accessible names for meaningful images, status announcements on async transitions and >=4.5:1 text contrast where WCAG AA applies. For responsive visuals, measure component area with ResizeObserver or container queries (never poll viewport width each frame). Check scrollbars, animation disposal and browser console.
