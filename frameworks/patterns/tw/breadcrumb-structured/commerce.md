# Implementation pattern — Structured breadcrumbs / Commerce and checkout / Tailwind CSS v4

**Pattern ID:** `ztf-tw-breadcrumb-structured-commerce` · **Design intent:** Keep product context, price, shipping and primary actions accessible; no hidden costs.

## Before writing code
Audit the existing app and its actual framework version. Use Tailwind CSS v4 only if already selected or justified; never inject two CSS frameworks accidentally. Confirm the real content, loading states and integration routes.

## Executable markup starter
```html
<nav id="breadcrumb-structured-tw-commerce-and-checkout" aria-label="Structured breadcrumbs">
  <div class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2">
    <a href="#overview" aria-current="page">Overview</a>
    <a href="#features">Features</a>
    <a href="#help">Help</a>
  </div>
</nav>
```

## Framework-specific treatment
- **Utilities / layout:** `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2`
- **Breakpoints and container:** sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280, 2xl 1536 default; use @container variants for reusable components.
- **Theme source:** Use top-level @theme to define utility-generating tokens and :root/[data-theme] for semantic alias variables.
- **RTL:** Use ms-*/me-*, text-start/text-end and dir-aware layout with rtl: variants.
- **Interaction and semantics:** Navigation must be operable by keyboard, expose current page, and preserve source order.
- **Performance:** native scrolling and static content first; avoid scroll event layout thrashing.

## Scenario-specific acceptance
Keep product context, price, shipping and primary actions accessible; no hidden costs.
- Critical criterion: **Current page is aria-current=page**.
- Test widths: 320,390,430,768,1024,1440 CSS pixels, plus portrait/landscape and nested sidebars.
- Test Persian labels that expand beyond the English length and preserve full context at 400% zoom.
- Confirm focus navigation, screen-reader purpose, reduced-motion behavior and no JavaScript failures.
- If the example is a shell rather than full product behavior, wire real app state/API and test it before claiming fully functional.

## Accessibility and visual QA
Use accessible names for meaningful images, status announcements on async transitions and >=4.5:1 text contrast where WCAG AA applies. For responsive visuals, measure component area with ResizeObserver or container queries (never poll viewport width each frame). Check scrollbars, animation disposal and browser console.
