# Implementation pattern — Status toast shell / Documentation and knowledge / Bootstrap v5.3

**Pattern ID:** `ztf-bs-toast-feedback-docs` · **Design intent:** Keep heading anchors, skip navigation, readable measure and code scrolling.

## Before writing code
Audit the existing app and its actual framework version. Use Bootstrap v5.3 only if already selected or justified; never inject two CSS frameworks accidentally. Confirm the real content, loading states and integration routes.

## Executable markup starter
```html
<section id="toast-feedback-bs-documentation-and-knowledge" role="status" aria-live="polite" class="toast-container position-fixed bottom-0 end-0 p-3">
 <h3>Status toast shell</h3><p>Loading your Documentation and knowledge content. An update will be announced here.</p>
</section>
```

## Framework-specific treatment
- **Utilities / layout:** `toast-container position-fixed bottom-0 end-0 p-3`
- **Breakpoints and container:** xs <576, sm >=576, md >=768, lg >=992, xl >=1200, xxl >=1400; mobile first.
- **Theme source:** Use data-bs-theme and --bs-* CSS custom properties, customize Sass using functions -> variables -> maps -> mixins ordering.
- **RTL:** Use bootstrap.rtl.min.css with <html dir="rtl" lang="fa">; prefer ms-* / me-* and start/end semantics.
- **Interaction and semantics:** Use role=status or an appropriate aria-live region; announce actual state transitions without flooding.
- **Performance:** native scrolling and static content first; avoid scroll event layout thrashing.

## Scenario-specific acceptance
Keep heading anchors, skip navigation, readable measure and code scrolling.
- Critical criterion: **Live region and no disappearing critical errors**.
- Test widths: 320,375,768,1024,1440,1920 CSS pixels, plus portrait/landscape and nested sidebars.
- Test Persian labels that expand beyond the English length and preserve full context at 400% zoom.
- Confirm focus navigation, screen-reader purpose, reduced-motion behavior and no JavaScript failures.
- If the example is a shell rather than full product behavior, wire real app state/API and test it before claiming fully functional.

## Accessibility and visual QA
Use accessible names for meaningful images, status announcements on async transitions and >=4.5:1 text contrast where WCAG AA applies. For responsive visuals, measure component area with ResizeObserver or container queries (never poll viewport width each frame). Check scrollbars, animation disposal and browser console.
