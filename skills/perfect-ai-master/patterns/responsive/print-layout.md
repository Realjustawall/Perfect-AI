# Accessible printable version

## Purpose & algorithm
Remove 3D and motion, show URLs and content, avoid clipped overflow.

## Implementation CSS
```css
@media print{nav,.three-host canvas,.floating-cta{display:none!important}body{color:#000;background:#fff}a{text-decoration:underline}section{break-inside:avoid}}
```

## Interaction/accessibility/state contract
Every control must have semantic labels, a visible focus indicator, keyboard activation, touch access, and meaningful empty/loading/error/fallback behavior. CSS changes must not reorder semantic DOM reading flow. RTL must use logical properties where applicable; do not reverse numbers/code unexpectedly.

## Validation procedure
Inspect computed layout at 320, 390, 768, 1024, 1440 CSS px; also recheck with 200%/400% zoom, 320x568, landscape short height, long Persian+English strings, reduced motion, keyboard focus and disabled JS. For 3D/animation explicitly test unavailable GPU and context disposal. Diagnose real overflow rather than hiding it.

## Completion report
Record screenshots/check results actually gathered; mention intentional compromises and unsupported features. This is a locally written implementation pattern, not third-party copied source.
