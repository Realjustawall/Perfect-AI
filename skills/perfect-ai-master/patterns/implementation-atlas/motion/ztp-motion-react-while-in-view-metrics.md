# Pattern: Motion React viewport entrance for KPI strip

**Pattern ID:** `ztp-motion-react-while-in-view-metrics`  
**Technique:** MOTION / Motion React viewport entrance  
**Audience:** Persian + English, desktop/mobile, touch/keyboard.  
**Reference:** https://motion.dev/docs/react-scroll-animations

## Why and when

Declarative in-view entrance with reduced motion. In the **KPI strip** context: metric values and context. Important constraint: **units and numbers must be clear**. 

## Implementation prerequisites

- npm install motion. Use the existing project package manager and do not install packages without checking existing versions.
- Base responsive contract: inline sizes 320–2560 CSS px, content width independent of device, safe areas, container queries where useful.
- Create HTML semantic structure first; running animations are progressive enhancement, never a substitute for functionality.
- For a Perfect_AI request, honor the strict monochrome design system; otherwise choose colors through the palette-decision engine and audit contrast.

## Scoped markup starter (adapt, not copy into every component)

```html
<section id="zt-react-while-in-view-metrics" lang="fa" dir="rtl" aria-label="KPI strip">
  <h2 data-zt-heading>KPI strip: clear, real heading</h2>
  <div data-zt-collection>
    <p data-zt-item>Actual readable content; replace with verified product copy.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" data-zt-trigger>Open details</button>
  <span data-zt-status role="status"></span>
  <div data-zt-scene aria-hidden="true"></div>
  <!-- SVG-specific effects: add an accessible <svg> with [data-zt-path] and [data-zt-marker]. -->
  <!-- Draggable effect: add a nonessential visual node [data-zt-drag]. -->
  <!-- Dialog effect: add native <dialog> with [data-zt-close] control. -->
</section>
```

**Scaffold note:** Replace placeholder copy with project data, preserve heading hierarchy, and do not create imaginary claims.

## Technique implementation

```jsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from 'motion/react';
export function Entrance({children}){const reduced=useReducedMotion();return <motion.div initial={reduced?false:{opacity:0,y:14}} whileInView={{opacity:1,y:0}} viewport={{once:true,amount:.25}} transition={{duration:.55}}>{children}</motion.div>; }
// Wrap only the noncritical animation layer, not form focus logic.
```

**Runtime contract:** For `.jsx` snippets place the component in a React file and provide children. For vanilla-JS snippets import from `motion` in the bundler. Pin compatible Motion and React versions.

## Interaction specification

1. Initial: content is visible and usable without JS, including with WebGL unsupported.
2. Enter/gesture: motion runs only when useful; keyboard/touch users get the same affordance and outcome.
3. During interaction: preserve critical pointer events and focus. Avoid forced synchronous layout in a frame callback.
4. Cancel/interruption: dispose observers, timers, animation handles and GPU resources, restore original styles.
5. Reverse/navigate: scroll back restores progress or safely retains final state; no duplicate listeners after route changes.

## Responsive + RTL acceptance matrix

| Width or mode | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| 320–374px | one-column content, no horizontal overflow, full labels and usable tap targets |
| 375–767px | natural wrapping, dynamic browser chrome, safe-area padding |
| 768–1023px | 2-column only if container is wide enough; no reliance on hover |
| 1024–1439px | balanced layout and legible supporting copy, bounded motion amplitude |
| >=1440px | max-width limits; 3D/compositing resolution remains budgeted |
| Persian RTL | logical CSS properties, correct mixed-direction numerals and focus flow |
| 200–400% zoom | content reflows without clipped functional elements |
| Reduced motion / WebGL blocked | static readable content; controls remain functional |

## Definition of done

- [ ] Correct semantic hierarchy and real content for kpi strip.
- [ ] Verified: tabular numerals and live updates controlled.
- [ ] Contrast target >= 4.5:1 for normal text, >= 3:1 for relevant UI boundaries and large text.
- [ ] Tested 320, 390, 768, 1024 and 1440px, RTL/LTR, keyboard, coarse pointer, reduced motion.
- [ ] No hidden error in the console; no React component leaks; screenshots compared where visual fidelity matters.
- [ ] Run bundle/build/lint + targeted browser test; document any unverified dependency-specific sample.
