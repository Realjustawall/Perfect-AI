# Adaptive calendar shell — Documentation and knowledge (Bootstrap v5.3)

Use this skill when asked to implement, migrate, debug or review the corresponding real interface feature. You MUST implement actual code in the user's repository; do not merely paste advice. Do not request MCP.

## Task and plan
**Goal:** Adaptive calendar shell. **Context:** Documentation and knowledge. **Acceptance:** Table/grid semantics and keyboard navigation need adapter. **Product emphasis:** Keep heading anchors, skip navigation, readable measure and code scrolling.

1. Inspect lockfile and existing design system. Verify that the correct framework and version is installed.
2. Read `../../frameworks/patterns/bs/calendar-grid/docs.md` from this ZIP or, after skill-only installation, use the **embedded recipe below** without depending on external files.
3. Build the semantic structure and wire interactions. Use tokens before choosing visual styling.
4. Test and repair across the acceptance matrix; report actual evidence.

## Embedded implementation
```html
<section id="calendar-grid-bs-documentation-and-knowledge" aria-labelledby="calendar-grid-bs-documentation-and-knowledge-title">
  <h2 id="calendar-grid-bs-documentation-and-knowledge-title">Adaptive calendar shell · Documentation and knowledge</h2>
  <div class="row row-cols-7 g-1">
    <article><h3>Overview</h3><p>Accessible supporting context with real content.</p></article>
    <article><h3>Details</h3><p>Secondary information is readable at narrow widths.</p></article>
    <article><h3>Next action</h3><p>Details remain visible without hover.</p></article>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Framework and integration rules
- `npm install bootstrap@^5.3.8` only if necessary and approved in the host project.
- Use data-bs-theme and --bs-* CSS custom properties, customize Sass using functions -> variables -> maps -> mixins ordering.
- Use bootstrap.rtl.min.css with <html dir="rtl" lang="fa">; prefer ms-* / me-* and start/end semantics.
- Use semantic grouping and a layout that reflows intrinsically; never attach fixed pixel widths to content.
- xs <576, sm >=576, md >=768, lg >=992, xl >=1200, xxl >=1400; mobile first.

## Motion / color integration
Choose semantic colors with the original Perfect_AI palette engine and `COLOR-SCIENCE-ULTIMATE.md`. In strict monochrome contexts, do not add colorful gradients. For Anime.js, scope animation, honor reduced motion and dispose on route transitions. For Three.js, provide static fallback, performance caps and resize camera/renderer correctly. Do not animate layout-critical dimensions on every scroll frame.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Table/grid semantics and keyboard navigation need adapter
- [ ] Narrow/wide layout, nested containers, RTL/LTR and 400% zoom pass.
- [ ] Accessible labels, focus, contrast, keyboard/touch, reduced motion pass.
- [ ] Build, tests and targeted browser interaction executed; no uncaught runtime errors.
- [ ] Limitations or unimplemented integration endpoints explicitly disclosed.
