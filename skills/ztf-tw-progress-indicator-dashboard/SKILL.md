# Task progress bar — Data-heavy application (Tailwind CSS v4)

Use this skill when asked to implement, migrate, debug or review the corresponding real interface feature. You MUST implement actual code in the user's repository; do not merely paste advice. Do not request MCP.

## Task and plan
**Goal:** Task progress bar. **Context:** Data-heavy application. **Acceptance:** Expose value and textual percent. **Product emphasis:** Preserve navigation and data density while supporting panel resizing and empty states.

1. Inspect lockfile and existing design system. Verify that the correct framework and version is installed.
2. Read `../../frameworks/patterns/tw/progress-indicator/dashboard.md` from this ZIP or, after skill-only installation, use the **embedded recipe below** without depending on external files.
3. Build the semantic structure and wire interactions. Use tokens before choosing visual styling.
4. Test and repair across the acceptance matrix; report actual evidence.

## Embedded implementation
```html
<section id="progress-indicator-tw-data-heavy-application" role="status" aria-live="polite" class="h-2 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-full bg-zinc-200">
 <h3>Task progress bar</h3><p>Loading your Data-heavy application content. An update will be announced here.</p>
</section>
```

## Framework and integration rules
- `npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite` only if necessary and approved in the host project.
- Use top-level @theme to define utility-generating tokens and :root/[data-theme] for semantic alias variables.
- Use ms-*/me-*, text-start/text-end and dir-aware layout with rtl: variants.
- Use role=status or an appropriate aria-live region; announce actual state transitions without flooding.
- sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280, 2xl 1536 default; use @container variants for reusable components.

## Motion / color integration
Choose semantic colors with the original Perfect_AI palette engine and `COLOR-SCIENCE-ULTIMATE.md`. In strict monochrome contexts, do not add colorful gradients. For Anime.js, scope animation, honor reduced motion and dispose on route transitions. For Three.js, provide static fallback, performance caps and resize camera/renderer correctly. Do not animate layout-critical dimensions on every scroll frame.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Expose value and textual percent
- [ ] Narrow/wide layout, nested containers, RTL/LTR and 400% zoom pass.
- [ ] Accessible labels, focus, contrast, keyboard/touch, reduced motion pass.
- [ ] Build, tests and targeted browser interaction executed; no uncaught runtime errors.
- [ ] Limitations or unimplemented integration endpoints explicitly disclosed.
