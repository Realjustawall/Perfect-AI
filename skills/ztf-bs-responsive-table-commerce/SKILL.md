# Responsive data table — Commerce and checkout (Bootstrap v5.3)

Use this skill when asked to implement, migrate, debug or review the corresponding real interface feature. You MUST implement actual code in the user's repository; do not merely paste advice. Do not request MCP.

## Task and plan
**Goal:** Responsive data table. **Context:** Commerce and checkout. **Acceptance:** Horizontal scroll confined to table wrapper. **Product emphasis:** Keep product context, price, shipping and primary actions accessible; no hidden costs.

1. Inspect lockfile and existing design system. Verify that the correct framework and version is installed.
2. Read `../../frameworks/patterns/bs/responsive-table/commerce.md` from this ZIP or, after skill-only installation, use the **embedded recipe below** without depending on external files.
3. Build the semantic structure and wire interactions. Use tokens before choosing visual styling.
4. Test and repair across the acceptance matrix; report actual evidence.

## Embedded implementation
```html
<div class="table-responsive" tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label="Responsive data table horizontal scrolling">
 <table id="responsive-table-bs-commerce-and-checkout" class="table table-striped align-middle"><caption>Responsive data table for Commerce and checkout</caption>
 <thead><tr><th scope="col">Item</th><th scope="col">Status</th><th scope="col">Owner</th><th scope="col">Updated</th></tr></thead>
 <tbody><tr><th scope="row">Alpha</th><td>Active</td><td>Team A</td><td>Today</td></tr>
 <tr><th scope="row">Beta</th><td>Pending</td><td>Team B</td><td>Yesterday</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
```

## Framework and integration rules
- `npm install bootstrap@^5.3.8` only if necessary and approved in the host project.
- Use data-bs-theme and --bs-* CSS custom properties, customize Sass using functions -> variables -> maps -> mixins ordering.
- Use bootstrap.rtl.min.css with <html dir="rtl" lang="fa">; prefer ms-* / me-* and start/end semantics.
- Use <table>, <caption>, scope on headers and an overflow wrapper with accessible keyboard scrolling.
- xs <576, sm >=576, md >=768, lg >=992, xl >=1200, xxl >=1400; mobile first.

## Motion / color integration
Choose semantic colors with the original Perfect_AI palette engine and `COLOR-SCIENCE-ULTIMATE.md`. In strict monochrome contexts, do not add colorful gradients. For Anime.js, scope animation, honor reduced motion and dispose on route transitions. For Three.js, provide static fallback, performance caps and resize camera/renderer correctly. Do not animate layout-critical dimensions on every scroll frame.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Horizontal scroll confined to table wrapper
- [ ] Narrow/wide layout, nested containers, RTL/LTR and 400% zoom pass.
- [ ] Accessible labels, focus, contrast, keyboard/touch, reduced motion pass.
- [ ] Build, tests and targeted browser interaction executed; no uncaught runtime errors.
- [ ] Limitations or unimplemented integration endpoints explicitly disclosed.
